This repository provides examples that use data structures and algorithms to solve real-life problems. It is completely open source and anyone can contribute. The purpose of this repo is to internalize algorithms and data structures. To do this, we will of course use various programming languages and we will not be dependent on a single programming language. Visit the "src/programming_languages" folder to see problems in any programming language.
